    <h1>Modak Recipe</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Modak is a traditional Indian sweet dumpling, popularly prepared during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi as an offering to Lord Ganesha. These delicate, steamed treats feature an outer covering made from rice flour, filled with a delicious mixture of grated coconut, jaggery, cardamom, and nuts. Soft, aromatic, and mildly sweet, modaks are cherished both spiritually and gastronomically across India.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 cup rice flour</li> 
        <li>1¼ cups water</li> 
        <li>Pinch of salt</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon ghee or oil</li> 
        <li>1 cup grated fresh coconut</li> 
        <li>¾ cup jaggery, grated</li> 
        <li>½ teaspoon cardamom powder</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Mix in cardamom powder and nuts; remove from heat and let it cool.</li> 
        <li>In another pan, boil water with salt and ghee. Reduce heat, gradually add rice flour, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.</li>

        <li>Steam modaks in a steamer or pressure cooker (without whistle) for 10-12 mins until cooked.</li> 
        <li>Serve warm with a drizzle of ghee.</li>
